                        <p>019059-00064 Version 2 Approved by Sanford Health IRB: 06/29/2015</p>



                        <p>You are being asked to give a sample to the Sanford BioBank. The Sanford BioBank has two
                            arms, the Clinical DNA Bank
                            and the Research BioBank. The Clinical DNA Bank stores your DNA for use in your health care
                            treatment, future
                            clinical testing, or health care of a blood relative. The other arm, the Research BioBank,
                            is used to store DNA,
                            blood and tissue samples for future health research. You may choose to participate in both
                            arms, one, or not
                            participate at all.</p>



                        <p>Please read the following information carefully. There is no cost to participate in either
                            the Clinical DNA Bank or
                            Research BioBank.</p>



                        <p><strong>What is DNA?</strong></p>



                        <p>DNA contains genetic information that acts as a blueprint for how parts of your body are made
                            and work, determining
                            such things as eye and hair color. DNA is made up of long strands of repeating letters that
                            form a code. These
                            letters, A, C, T and G represent individual chemical units that form DNA. The order in which
                            these letters are
                            written is very precise. In the same way that a spelling mistake in a word could change its
                            meaning entirely (for
                            example, mean and meat), a single change in the sequence of DNA can lead to a change in how
                            the body works, which
                            may lead to disease or influence how you respond to medication.</p>



                        <p><strong>What is genetic testing?</strong></p>



                        <p>Genetic testing involves taking your DNA sample and determining the sequence of your genetic
                            code. Changes in your
                            genetic code may help your healthcare team choose the best course of treatment for you.</p>



                        <p><strong>What is Genetic Inheritance?</strong></p>



                        <p>Both your mother and father contribute DNA sequences that make up your genetic code. This is
                            called inheritance.
                            Often, changes in DNA sequence can be passed from parent to offspring and it may be
                            important to study not only your
                            DNA, but also the DNA of your parents and other family members, to identify the underlying
                            causes of disease.</p>



                        <h2>CLINICAL DNA BANK</h2>



                        <p>What is involved in the Clinical DNA Bank?</p>



                        <p>Sanford is offering you the opportunity to have a sample of your DNA preserved for use in
                            future clinical diagnostic
                            testing. This DNA will be stored by Sanford and will solely be used for your health care, or
                            for the health care of
                            your blood relatives.</p>



                        <p>A sample of your DNA will be obtained through a blood draw (up to two teaspoons). In the
                            event that a blood sample
                            cannot be obtained, we may ask you to provide a sample of your saliva.</p>



                        <p><strong>What are the risks of providing a sample for the Clinical DNA Bank?</strong></p>



                        <p>The risks associated with having blood drawn are no greater than that you would experience
                            from having a blood test
                            performed as part of your routine health care. This includes some pain or bruising where the
                            blood was taken. It is
                            also possible, though rare, that there may be some local blood clotting or infection. Some
                            people experience a
                            feeling of lightheadedness or fainting when they have blood drawn. If you should experience
                            these feelings, it is
                            important that you tell the person who is drawing your blood, so that you can lie down
                            immediately to avoid possible
                            injury caused by falling.</p>

                        <p>Approved by Sanford Health IRB: 06/29/2015 2</p>



                        <p><strong>Who will have access to my DNA sample?</strong></p>



                        <p>Your DNA sample will be stored by Sanford for future clinical use. Until your sample is
                            needed for clinical testing,
                            no access will be granted. When access to your DNA sample is needed for your health care
                            treatment or that of your
                            blood relatives, the provider directly involved in that treatment will be granted access to
                            your sample for testing.
                            Any results from that testing will be incorporated into your medical record, or the medical
                            record of your blood
                            relative, as applicable, and re-disclosed with that medical record in the future.</p>



                        <p>Upon my death, I agree the following persons (hereinafter “my decision makers”) in the order
                            of pri- ority listed are
                            authorized to consent to testing of my sample(s) in Sanford’s Clinical Biobank:</p>



                        <ol type="1">
                            <li>The personal representative of my Estate, if any;</li>
                            <li>My spouse, if any;</li>
                            <li>My adult children, if any.</li>
                        </ol>



                        <p>I authorize my decision makers to consent to testing in accordance with Sanford’s policies as
                            reviewed from
                            time-to-time by the Sanford Biobank Ethics Committee. Sanford agrees to recognize the
                            author- ity of my decision
                            makers for purposes of consenting to testing of my sample(s) in Sanford’s Clinical Biobank,
                            unless otherwise
                            prohibited by law. If there is any dispute regarding consent for testing of my sample(s), I
                            understand Sanford will
                            need a court order directing testing before Sanford will move forward with testing.</p>



                        <p>You will not have any ownership rights in any specimens you contribute to the Sanford BioBank
                            and you will not
                            receive money or any other form of payment for these specimens. These specimens will be
                            owned by Sanford.</p>



                        <p>You may choose to withdraw from the Clinical DNA Bank at any time by informing the Sanford
                            BioBank in writing. We
                            will destroy any remaining samples in the Clinical DNA Bank, however, any samples or data
                            that has been distributed
                            for laboratory testing or test results generated prior to your request to withdraw may
                            continue to be used for
                            health care purposes.</p>



                        <p><strong>How long will my DNA sample be available?</strong></p>



                        <p>Your DNA sample will be stored for as long as the Sanford BioBank is in operation. Storing
                            your DNA sample
                            indefinitely is necessary to ensure that you and your blood relatives will benefit from
                            testing of your DNA sample
                            when needed for their health care treatment.</p>



                        <p>There is a possibility that DNA samples may be lost in transit or will be inadequate for a
                            future test, due to
                            unforeseen power failures, equipment failures, floods, or other circumstances. It is also
                            important to know that a
                            DNA sample is not permanent. If used for one test it may be depleted so that sufficient DNA
                            might not be available
                            for additional testing. Sanford is not liable for damage to or loss of a DNA sample. Sanford
                            has no fiduciary duty
                            to you, your family, or heirs, successors,or assigns, other than to use the sample for its
                            designated purpose and to
                            refrain from using the sample for research or commercial purposes. Sanford has no duty to
                            account to you or any of
                            your family members, heirs, successors, or assigns, or to guardians, attorneys-in-fact, or
                            trustees.</p>

                        <p>In the following section, you will be given information about providing a sample for research
                            purposes in addition to
                            the Clinical DNA Bank sample. At the end of this form, you will be given the choice to
                            participate in both the
                            Clinical DNA Bank and Research BioBank, one,</p>

                        <h2>RESEARCH BIOBANK</h2>


                        <p>Principal Investigator: Chun-Hung Chan, PhD</p>


                        <p><strong>**WHAT IS THE PURPOSE OF THE RESEARCH BIOBANK?</strong></p>

                        <p>** The purpose of the Research BioBank is to collect, process, and store samples until
                            researchers need them to do
                            research. A major obstacle in health research is that researchers normally study diseases in
                            patients after the
                            disease develops, by which time many changes have already taken place in the body. We would
                            like to store blood and
                            tissue samples, along with health information obtained from your medical record, so that
                            researchers can study
                            components of your blood and tissue, such as proteins or DNA, both before and after disease
                            develops. This may help
                            researchers to understand the causes of disease, how to treat them, and how disease might be
                            prevented.</p>



                        <p>The samples we collect will act as a library for researchers who are interested in studying a
                            wide variety of human
                            health conditions; instead of looking for volunteers for each new research study,
                            researchers will have access to a
                            large collection of blood, tissue and DNA samples along with medical histories all in one
                            place, therefore greatly
                            accelerating the pace of research.</p>



                        <p>Taking part in this Research BioBank does not mean we think you will develop a disease. Your
                            samples may be used as
                            healthy control subjects in future research studies.</p>



                        <p><strong>**WHAT IS INVOLVED IN THE PROJECT?</strong></p>



                        <p>** To participate in the Research BioBank, every time you have your blood drawn, we may
                            collect up to 4 teaspoons of
                            blood for research. If you are scheduled to undergo surgery at a Sanford facility, we may
                            also obtain a sample of
                            your surgical tissue that is not needed for diagnostic purposes and would otherwise be
                            disposed. This will not
                            affect the quality of care you receive from your health care team.</p>



                        <p>As part of this project we will look at your medical record from time to time to update the
                            information for the
                            Research BioBank and to collect information for future studies. This will take place for as
                            long as your sample is
                            stored, which may be many years unless you tell us to stop.</p>



                        <p><strong>WHAT PERSONAL HEALTH INFORMATION WILL BE USED OR DISCLOSED?</strong></p>



                        <p>You are authorizing Sanford BioBank personnel to copy and use information contained in your
                            medical record. The
                            health information that may be used or disclosed for the research includes: results of
                            physical examinations,
                            medical history, lab tests, or certain health information indicating or relating to a
                            particular condition.</p>



                        <p><strong>**ARE MY RECORDS CONFIDENTIAL?</strong></p>



                        <p>** The records of the Research BioBank will be kept confidential in accordance with
                            applicable law.</p>

                            confidential and will be disclosed only with your permission or as allowed or required by
                            law. Your samples will be
                            stored in a secure facility in barcoded tubes with no identifying information. The code
                            needed to link your samples
                            to your medical record will be stored in a secure, password protected database with access

                        <p>Results of tests and studies performed by researchers will not be included in your medical
                            records. The results of
                            the studies will not be shared with you by the Research BioBank.</p>



                        <p>In many cases your samples will be used without any identifying information. If a researcher
                            using your sample needs
                            to know who the sample came from, they will need to obtain approval from the Sanford IRB. If
                            approval is given, the
                            researcher may contact you to obtain separate informed consent for their study. The Sanford
                            IRB is a group of people
                            who review research to protect your rights and welfare.</p>



                        <p>With your permission, you may also be contacted in the future by Sanford to invite you to
                            take part in a research
                            study. You may decide whether or not to take part in these future studies at that time.</p>



                        <p>Your samples may also be used by researchers who are not associated with Sanford but they
                            will not receive any
                            identifying information about you.</p>



                        <p><strong>HOW LONG WILL I BE IN THE RESEARCH BIOBANK?</strong></p>



                        <p>If you decide to participate, your blood and tissue samples, as well as your health
                            information will be stored
                            indefinitely. You may withdraw from the Research BioBank at any time by informing the
                            Sanford BioBank that you no
                            longer wish to participate.</p>



                        <p>If you choose to withdraw from the Research BioBank, please make your request in writing to
                            the BioBank. We will
                            destroy any of your samples remaining in the Research BioBank and remove your medical
                            information from our database.
                            However, any samples or data that has been distributed to researchers, or data generated
                            from your samples prior to
                            your request to withdraw may continue to be used for research purposes.</p>



                        <p><strong>WHAT ARE THE RISKS?</strong></p>



                        <p>The risks associated with a blood draw are the same as described earlier. If you are already
                            having your blood drawn,
                            there are no additional risks associated with having an additional sample of blood taken.
                            There is no risk
                            associated with obtaining a sample of your surgical tissue beyond that associated with the
                            risks of surgery to which
                            you have already agreed to as part of your health care.</p>



                        <p>The biggest risk to you is the unexpected release of your personal health information. While
                            we cannot guarantee
                            absolute confidentiality, we will use best efforts to minimize the risk that this
                            information would be given to
                            someone outside of the Research BioBank. Your blood sample and</p>

                        <p><strong>ARE THERE BENEFITS TO TAKING PART?</strong></p>



                        <p>While there may be no direct benefits to you, other people might benefit from knowledge
                            gained from using your
                            samples in future research studies.</p>
